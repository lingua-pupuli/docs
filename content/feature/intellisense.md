## Intellisense



## Live Workspace Intellisense

If you are editing a module, or a [Control Repository](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/control_repo.html), you will now get live intellisense of the [Puppet Custom Types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/custom_types.html), [Functions](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_write_functions_in_puppet.html), [Classes](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_classes.html) and [Defined Types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_defined_types.html). For example if you are editing the [puppetlabs-apache module](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache) you will be able to get auto-complete for resources like `apache::vhost` or `apache::mod::php`.

> Note: Workspace Intellisense is only updated when you save a file, instead of features like linting which update as you type
