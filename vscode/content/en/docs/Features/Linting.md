  Automatic puppet-lint linting and error checking

Linting is automatically applied to the document as you edit, without having to save the file first. The validation uses [puppet-lint](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-lint) to validate the Puppet syntax in all open puppet files. Errors and warnings appear in the Problems window in VSCode.
